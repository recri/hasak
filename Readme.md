# hasak cw keyer

Hasak is firmware for the CWKeyerShield described in
https://github.com/softerhardware/CWKeyer.  

With appropriate wiring, it also works on bare Teensy 
microprocessors, Teensy microprocessors with the Teensy
Audio Adapter, and Teensy microprocessors on hardware
specifically designed for hasak.

Hasak is designed to combine the Teensy hardware, the Teensy Audio
library, and the Musical Instrument Device Interface (MIDI) to make 
a highly configurable cw keyer that allows sample accurate timing.
