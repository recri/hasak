* The hasak keyer is a Teensy application and a Web application
** The Teensy application provides
   low latency action,
   audio synthesis,
** The Web application provides
   an adaptive user interface,
   flexible storage,
   and connection to other apps.
** The Teensy application is a
   Serial-MIDI-Audio composite USB device
*** The serial interface is used
    to manage structured information
    that isn't easily represented as
    audio streams or MIDI events
**** Install a serial event loop in the web and teensy.
**** Transfer strings of known length which parse to
     commands
**** The JSON which details the MIDI notes, controls, and nrpns    
**** The strings of text which are sent and received
**** Saved blocks of MIDI parameters which distinguish
     different keyer voices or modes of operation.
***** so "save keyer" for instance returns a string which is
     a JSON representation/associative array of nrpn: value pairs
