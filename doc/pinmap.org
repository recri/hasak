* Pin allocations for different versions of Teensy
** Concentrating on the common pinout for the common
   28 pins.
** The allocations ignore any extra pins provided
   except when they provide the hdw_out ports.
** The hdw_in port, using a hardware ADC, is not
   allocated.
** No pwm_out port is allocated.   
** There is an additional audio input path allocated
   in the audio library graph, it could be used for
   a hdw_in device or a second i2s device input, but
   this would require modifications to the hasak source.

* The CW Keyer assignment of ADC8 to the SPEED pot cannot be supported
  because it conflicts with the I2S assignments on the Teensy 3.x
  But no one will ever succeed in using a Teensy 3.x in the Cw Keyer
  board, so we can soft assign pin 22 to SPEED on the CW Keyer board
* On the hasak board, we can assign everything except the POTs as it is on the 
  CW Keyer board.  We also route the Teensy 3 I2S signals to the codec. 
** The signal for pin 23 is MCLK4 but LRCLK3, so it will need to be jumpered when
   switching between a Teensy 3 and a Teensy 4.
** The rest of the I2S signals may be okay connected to two pins, one of which is
   quiescent, or more of them may need to jumpered.  It's 4 additional jumpers, it
   could be a jumper block of 5x3 headers, or maybe a 5P2T DIP switch.
** Oh, so the I2C connection is routed to the audio adapter, too,
** In any case, this assignment leaves me with pins 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17
   unassigned, so I have pins for a second paddle, second key/ptt in, and second
   key/ptt out, with one left over.  Or pins 14, 15, 16, and 17 could be optionally
   assigned to ADC inputs.
** We end up with a design that has no moving parts other than the springs in the
   audio jacks, but they're easy to desolder and replace.
** We have miscellaneous support components to make the audio codec work.
** We have optical isolators on the key/ptt out lines.
** We have resistors on the keyed input lines to debounce.
** We have a level shifter on the Grove connector that routes I2C off board
