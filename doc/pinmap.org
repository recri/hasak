* Pin allocations for different versions of Teensy
** Concentrating on the common pinout for the common 28 pins.
** The allocations ignore any extra pins provided by different
   Teensy's, except when they provide the hdw_out ports, as on
   the Teensy 3.x.
** The hdw_in port, using a hardware ADC, is not allocated.
   The hdw_in port would be on A2, A3 if enabled, and it might
   preclude any analog_read() uses.
** The serial port, for talking to the gps, would be on A1, A0 as
   RX3, TX3, but only if enabled.
** If we skip hdw_out and LED, then we can have a SPI interface on
   10, 11, 12, and 13
** No pwm_out port is allocated.   
** There is an additional audio input path allocated
   in the audio library graph, it could be used for
   a hdw_in device or a second i2s device input, but
   this would require modifications to the hasak source.
   [Not sure this is true, but it could certainly be made
    to be true.]
** The audio graph should allow for 4 audio input and output paths
*** USB in/out
*** HDW in/out ADC and MQS
*** I2S 1A and 1B channels

* Note that A14/DAC on the 3.1/3.2 is an end of the board pin, not in the same location as A14 on 3.5/3.6.
* The CW Keyer assignment of ADC8 to the SPEED pot cannot be supported
  because it conflicts with the I2S assignments on the Teensy 3.x
  But no one will ever succeed in using a Teensy 3.x in the Cw Keyer
  board, so we can soft assign pin 22 to SPEED on the CW Keyer board
** This makes life confusing, because I can't really figure out how to write
   the description in a way that makes sense.  I guess we have pins which are
   always available as digital i/o and/or analog input, and pins which may be
   made available on the 3.x, or 4.x, or when no i2s audio is installed.
* On the hasak board, we can assign everything except the POTs as it is on the 
  CW Keyer board.  We also route the Teensy 3 I2S signals to the codec. 
** The signal for pin 23 is MCLK4 but LRCLK3, so it will need to be jumpered when
   switching between a Teensy 3 and a Teensy 4.
** The rest of the I2S signals may be okay connected to two pins, one of which is
   quiescent, or more of them may need to jumpered.  It's 4 additional jumpers, it
   could be a jumper block of 5x3 headers, or maybe a 5P2T DIP switch.
** Oh, so the I2C connection is routed to the audio adapter, too,
** In any case, this assignment leaves me with pins 6, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17
   unassigned, so I have pins for a second paddle, second key/ptt in, and second
   key/ptt out, with one left over.  Or pins 14, 15, 16, and 17 could be optionally
   assigned to ADC inputs.
** We end up with a design that has no moving parts other than the springs in the
   audio jacks, but they're easy to desolder and replace.
** We have miscellaneous support components to make the audio codec work.
** We have optical isolators on the key/ptt out lines.
** We have resistors on the keyed input lines to debounce.
** We have a level shifter on the Grove connector that routes I2C off board
* Rethink the Hasak board
** Make a solder pad connected to each Teensy header pin pad for customization
** Make a scratch out connection for each standard connection for customization
** Wire pins 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to paddle, key in, ptt in, key out, and ptt out.
** Digital input pads are just bypassed to ground with a cap  (0.001µF).  We lay 
   them out so that it's easy to connect TS, TRS, or TRRS cables.  Basically a 
   row of input pin pads interleaved with ground pads, with the bypass caps 
   installed between adjacent input pin pads and input ground pads.  The
   default four input pins, 0-3, are connected to the first four input pin pads,
   the remainder of the possible input pin pads have solder pads for connection
   to Teensy digital IO pins.
** Digital output pads are buffered by series resistor (47K) a FET (2N7000), and
   bypassed by a cap (0.001µF). Or is it a solid state relay?  Or is it an optical
   isolator.  The buffer needs substantial current capacity, so small SMD parts aren't
   possible.
** Analog input pads are a direct connection to the pot wiper or the tail of a switched
   resistance ladder.  They're just like input pins but without the bypass capacitor.
   (Does it care?)
** So you could do the same for all pins, you'd need a way to insert the series resistor   
   and FET into the output lines.  That could be easy, need two wire jumpers to bypass
   the resistor and the FET, put the FET on an angle to the lines, which might not be
   a line when we get down to it.
