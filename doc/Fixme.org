* Restarting activity as of 2024-12-14
  Several mistakes in the code
** PTT_OUT is on pin 4, wired to socket ring, white wire on TRS cable
** KEY_OUT is on pin 5, wired to socket tip, red wire on TRS cable
** PTT_OUT and KEY_OUT pins are logic active high when driving the
   opto-isolator, which becomes active low when seen at the HL2 input.
** So the first hasak shield has the KEY/PTT/OUT pins reversed, but the
   signals go to the correct pins, 
** Fix
*** put PTT_OUT and KEY_OUT on the correct pins for the CWKeyerShield
*** swap the T and R on the output cable of the initial hasak shield
*** swap the output wiring on the prototype
*** installing 2N7000s on proto would allow it to function in same logic
    as the opto-isolator.
*** adding 0.001ÂµF bypass caps would short RF to ground
*** adding 470 ohm resistor
** Need a page in hasak.elf.org to set all parameters, need to flip the
   logic of the PTT_OUT and KEY_OUT
