* Todo list as of 2021-03-01
[x] add vox to keyer constructors
[x] declare keyer timing, tone, and ramp getters.
[x] define keyer timing, tone, ramp getters.
[x] define nrpn getter.
[x] add back the perdit, perdah, peries, perils, periws pseudo-nrpns
[x] figure out if that blackman-harris is right, it is.
[ ] add ramp pseudo-nrpns
[ ] get rid of the ramp crunches, 
	I think I'm passing an overflowed ramp value, I'm hearing the ramp
	scalar go negative at the peak.
[ ] Redo the ramp code.
[ ] Figure out why the buffer allocation goes to 64k
[ ] Finish up the text_input
[ ] Install the lorem ipsum test text
[ ] Make the reusable buffer to run length code
[ ] Ease in the volume changes, get rid of the pop.
[ ] Make a keyed oscillator effect.
	[ ] Can turn the oscillator(s) off when not in use
	[ ] Poll oscillator and ramp parameters when activated
	[ ] Use the 1024 point window functions for the ramps.
	[ ] Continue to interpolate the ramps.
	[ ] Continue to interpolate the sine.
	[ ] Unless the fixed point complex rotor works, and with
	this multiply_32x32_rshift32 instruction, it might.
	[ ] Would still need the sine/cos interpolation to make
	the phase increment.
[ ] Implement the rest of the parameters
	[ ] Should all be polled at the last moment before they
	are applied.
	[ ] keyers poll for dit, dah, ies, ils, iws at the
	moment the element is to be started.
	[ ] oscillators poll for frequency and phase when started
	at the beginning of an element.
	[ ] ramp poll for ramp type and time length when starting
	the ramp.
	[ ] but the codec controls won't be polled, they must be
	pushed, but no hard volume changes.
[ ] Implement save/restore parameters to EEPROM
	[ ] save parameters as the nrpn block and a bitset of
	which have been set.
	[ ] restore parameters and bitset and apply those which
	must be pushed, but no hard volume changes.
[ ] Implement save/restore parameters as SYSEX
	[ ] nibblize the nrpn block and send it to the ctrlr
	which is built for slamming those things around.
[ ] Figure out floating valued modulators.  I can specify a
	controller which displays a floating point value, but
	when I try to scale it to an integer value for transmission
	it's already been truncated to its integer value.
