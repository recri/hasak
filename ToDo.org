* Todo list as of 2021-03-01
[x] add vox to keyer constructors
[x] declare keyer timing, tone, and ramp getters.
[x] define keyer timing, tone, ramp getters.
[x] define nrpn getter.
[x] add back the perdit, perdah, peries, perils, periws pseudo-nrpns
[x] figure out if that blackman-harris is right, it is.
[ ] add ramp pseudo-nrpns, translating 10ths of ms into samples
	I don't think it's necessary.  It's one multiply.
[ ] get rid of the ramp crunches, 
	I think I'm passing an overflowed ramp value, I'm hearing the ramp
	scalar go negative at the peak.
[x] Redo the ramp code.
[ ] Figure out why the buffer allocation goes to 64k
	It appears to have fixed itself somewhere.
	But now the cpu consumption is off scale
[x] Finish up the text_input
[x] Install the lorem ipsum test text
[x] Make the reusable buffer to run length code
	int16_t run_length(audio_buffer_t *block) returns the length of the first
	run in *block.
	Not necessary, the paddle is debounced by the keyer, text has no bounces,
	the straight key is the only signal with bounces, everything else is
	streams of zeros or ones longer than four 128 sample buffers, so each
	buffer (except for straight key) is describe by the initial run length.
[ ] Debounce the straight key.	
	Each transition in the straight key is stretched to one buffer worth
	before another transition is considered.
[ ] Ease in the volume changes, get rid of the pop.
[x] Make a keyed oscillator effect.
	[x] Can turn the oscillator(s) off when not in use
	[x] Poll oscillator and ramp parameters when activated
	[-] Use the 1024 point window functions for the ramps.
		no, only need the first half.
	[x] Continue to interpolate the ramps.
	[x] Continue to interpolate the sine.
	[ ] Unless the fixed point complex rotor works, and with
	this multiply_32x32_rshift32 instruction, it might.
	[ ] Would still need the sine/cos interpolation to make
	the phase increment.
[ ] Implement the rest of the parameters
	[ ] Should all be polled at the last moment before they
	are applied.
	[ ] keyers poll for dit, dah, ies, ils, iws at the
	moment the element is to be started.
	[x] oscillators poll for frequency and phase when started
	at the beginning of an element.
	[x] ramp poll for ramp type and time length when starting
	the ramp.
	[x] but the codec controls won't be polled, they must be
	pushed, but no hard volume changes.
[ ] Implement save/restore parameters to EEPROM
	[ ] save parameters as the nrpn block and a bitset of
	which have been set.
	[ ] restore parameters and bitset and apply those which
	must be pushed, but no hard volume changes.
[ ] Implement save/restore parameters as SYSEX
	[ ] nibblize the nrpn block and send it to the ctrlr
	which is built for slamming those things around.
[ ] Implement default parameters from flash.
[x] Figure out floating valued modulators.  I can specify a
	controller which displays a floating point value, but
	when I try to scale it to an integer value for transmission
	it's already been truncated to its integer value.
	I don't think they work, none of the example panels uses
	anything but int values.
[x] Add a 128 or 256 NRPN block for setting the 14 bit morse key codes 
	for 7 or 8 bit input characters.  Yeah, just 64 slots from ! to `.
[ ] Add tab to ctrlr panel for specifying morse key codes for characters.
[ ] Add tab to ctrlr panel for the mixer matrix, with presets.
[ ] Add NRPN for mixer matrix presets.
[ ] Pan sidetone to localize.
[ ] Add phase shifting filters to localize rx_audio.
[x] Define NRPN's in 4 blocks, pad each block so there's room for
	revisions without breaking existing assignments,
	nrpn[N_SOFT_NRPN+N_CODEC_NRPN+N_VOX_NRPN+(N_VOX*N_VOX_NRPN)
	[ ] codec NRPN's
	[ ] global keyer NRPN's
	[ ] morse code table
	[ ] mixer matrix
	[ ] default keyer voice NRPN's
	[ ] keyer voice specific NRPN's
[x] Move the IQ_ENABLE and IQ_ADJUST NRPN's to SOFT global block.
